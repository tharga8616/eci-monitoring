[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/graphiteapp/graphite-statsd.svg?style=flat)](https://hub.docker.com/r/graphiteapp/graphite-statsd/) [![Docker Size](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/graphiteapp/graphite-statsd.svg?style=flat&?sort=date)](https://hub.docker.com/r/graphiteapp/graphite-statsd/)


This is official Graphite docker image repo.

This repo produces two different repos on Docker Hub - https://hub.docker.com/r/graphiteapp/graphite-statsd (stable repo, with manual releases) and https://hub.docker.com/r/graphiteapp/docker-graphite-statsd (development repo, with automatic builds, unstable, use with caution!)

This repo was based on [@hopsoft's](https://github.com/hopsoft/) [docker-graphite-statsd](https://github.com/hopsoft/docker-graphite-statsd) docker image and was used as base for "official" Graphite docker image with his permission. Also, it contains parts of famous [@obfuscurity's](https://github.com/obfuscurity/) [synthesize](https://github.com/obfuscurity/synthesize) Graphite installer. Thanks a lot, Nathan and Jason!

Any suggestions / patches etc. are welcome!

# Docker Image for Graphite & Statsd

## Get Graphite & Statsd running instantly

Graphite & Statsd can be complex to setup.
This image will have you running & collecting stats in just a few minutes.

## Quick Start

```sh
docker run -d\
 --name graphite\
 --restart=always\
 -p 80:80\
 -p 2003-2004:2003-2004\
 -p 2023-2024:2023-2024\
 -p 8125:8125/udp\
 -p 8126:8126\
 graphiteapp/graphite-statsd
```

This starts a Docker container named: **graphite**

Please also note that you can freely remap container port to any host port in case of corresponding port is already occupied on host. It's also not mandatory to map all ports, map only required ports - please see table below.

That's it, you're done ... almost.



### Includes the following components

* [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) - reverse proxies the graphite dashboard
* [Graphite](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - front-end dashboard
* [Carbon](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/carbon-daemons.html) - back-end
* [Statsd](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/wiki) - UDP based back-end proxy

### Mapped Ports

Host | Container | Service
---- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  80 |        80 | [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/)
2003 |      2003 | [carbon receiver - plaintext](http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-plaintext-protocol)
2004 |      2004 | [carbon receiver - pickle](http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-pickle-protocol)
2023 |      2023 | [carbon aggregator - plaintext](http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/carbon-daemons.html#carbon-aggregator-py)
2024 |      2024 | [carbon aggregator - pickle](http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/carbon-daemons.html#carbon-aggregator-py)
8080 |      8080 | Graphite internal gunicorn port (without Nginx proxying).
8125 |      8125 | [statsd](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/blob/master/docs/server.md)
8126 |      8126 | [statsd admin](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/blob/master/docs/admin_interface.md)

By default, statsd listens on the UDP port 8125. If you want it to listen on the TCP port 8125 instead, you can set the environment variable `STATSD_INTERFACE` to `tcp` when running the container.

Please also note that you can freely remap container port to any host port in case of corresponding port is already occupied on host.

### Base Image

Version before (and including) 1.1.4-9 were built using [Phusion's base image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker). Current version is based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) because of image size (please see [PR#66](https://github.com/graphite-project/docker-graphite-statsd/pull/66) for details).

* All Graphite related processes are run as daemons & monitored with [runit](http://smarden.org/runit/).
* Includes additional services such as logrotate, nginx, optional Redis for TagDB and optional collectd instance.

## Start Using Graphite & Statsd

### Send Some Stats

Let's fake some stats with a random counter to prove things are working.

```sh
while true; do echo -n "example:$((RANDOM % 100))|c" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125; done
```

### Visualize the Data

Open Graphite in a browser.

* http://localhost/dashboard
* http://localhost/render?from=-10mins&until=now&target=stats.example

## Secure the Django Admin

Update the default Django admin user account. _The default is insecure._

  * username: root
  * password: root
  * email: root.graphite@mailinator.com

First login at: [http://localhost/account/login](http://localhost/account/login)
Then update the root user's profile at: [http://localhost/admin/auth/user/1/](http://localhost/admin/auth/user/1/)

## Tunables
Additional environment variables can be set to adjust performance.

* GRAPHITE_WSGI_PROCESSES: (4) the number of WSGI daemon processes that should be started
* GRAPHITE_WSGI_THREADS: (2) the number of threads to be created to handle requests in each daemon process

* GRAPHITE_WSGI_REQUEST_LINE: (0) The maximum size of HTTP request line in bytes.
* GRAPHITE_WSGI_WORKER_CLASS ("sync"): The type of workers to use. The default class (sync) should handle most “normal” types of workloads. See [gunucorn docs](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#worker-class).
* GRAPHITE_WSGI_WORKER_CONNECTIONS (1000): The maximum number of simultaneous clients (for Eventlet and Gevent worker types only). See [gunicorn docs](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#worker-connections).

### Graphite-web
* GRAPHITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS: (*) In Django 1.5+ set this to the list of hosts your graphite instances is accessible as. See: [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-ALLOWED_HOSTS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-ALLOWED_HOSTS)

* GRAPHITE_REPLICATION_FACTOR: (1) # The replication factor to use with consistent hashing. This should usually match the value configured in Carbon.
* GRAPHITE_CLUSTER_SERVERS: ('') This should list of remote servers in the cluster. These servers must each have local access to metric data. Note that the first server to return a match for a query will be used. See [docs](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config-local-settings.html#cluster-configuration) for details.
* GRAPHITE_USE_WORKER_POOL: (true) Creates a pool of worker threads to which tasks can be dispatched. This makes sense if there are multiple CLUSTER_SERVERS and/or STORAGE_FINDERS because then the communication with them can be parallelized.

* GRAPHITE_MAX_FETCH_RETRIES: (2) Number of retries for a specific remote data fetch
* GRAPHITE_FIND_CACHE_DURATION: (0) Time to cache remote metric find results
* GRAPHITE_STATSD_HOST: ("127.0.0.1") If set, django_statsd.middleware.GraphiteRequestTimingMiddleware and django_statsd.middleware.GraphiteMiddleware will be enabled.

Graphite stores tag information in a separate tag database (TagDB). Please check [tags documentation](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tags.html) for details.

* CARBON_DISABLE_TAGS: (false) if set to 1 or true will disable TagDB on carbon-cache.
* GRAPHITE_TAGDB: ('graphite.tags.localdatabase.LocalDatabaseTagDB') TagDB is a pluggable store, by default it uses the local SQLite database.
* REDIS_TAGDB: (false) if set to 1 or true will use local Redis instance to store tags.
* GRAPHITE_TAGDB_CACHE_DURATION: (60) Time to cache seriesByTag results.
* GRAPHITE_TAGDB_AUTOCOMPLETE_LIMIT: (100) Autocomplete default result limit.

## Collectd
Use `COLLECTD=1` environment variable to enable local collectd instance

## Carbon-cache
If custom environment `GRAPHITE_CARBONLINK_HOSTS` variable is setup `carbon-cache` instances as daemons/services are [managed](./conf/etc/run_once/carbon-cache) based on the that, otherwise default instance (`127.0.0.1:7002`) is used.

**Note**: if default port `7002` is used among the hosts, need to setup `CARBON_DISABLED=1` in the environment.

## Carbon-relay
Use `RELAY=1` environment variable to enable carbon relay instance. Use `[relay]` section of carbon.conf to configure it.

**Note**: in order to use `carbon-relay` daemon correctly, it must accept & distribute incoming traffic within DESTINATIONS
          endpoints which by default isn't (`carbon-cache` is). As one of solutions is to adjust `graphitePort` value to
          carbon-relay LINE_RECEIVER_PORT in [`statsd`](https://github.com/statsd/statsd/blob/master/exampleConfig.js) config.

## Logrotate
By default logs are rotated daily, using built-in `/etc/periodic/daily/logrotate` script. Please note, that according to Docker [logging best practices](https://success.docker.com/article/logging-best-practices) "Ideally, applications log to stdout/stderr, and Docker sends those logs to the configured logging destination.". You can use `-` as log file name for such behaviour.

## Runit
Each service started and controlled by runit will be gracefully shutdown when stopping the container : wait up to 7 seconds for the service to become down, then it will be killed. The runit environment variable `$SVWAIT` overrides this default timeout. Additionnally, a global timeout can be also specified with the docker-run option `--stop-timeout`.
Each service started by default can be disabled by setting an environment variable named as : `$<service name>_DISABLED`. For instance : `CARBON_AGGREGATOR_DISABLED=1`, `STATSD_DISABLED=1`, etc. Please note, that any service in image can be disabled, so, some functionality can be broken in this case.

## Startup custom scripts
At startup, entrypoint will run all scripts found in the directory /etc/run_once. It can be mounted with a docker-run option like this : `--mount type=bind,source=/path/to/run_once,destination=/etc/run_once`.

## Change the Configuration

Read up on Graphite's [post-install tasks](https://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#post-install-tasks).
Focus on the [storage-schemas.conf](https://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config-carbon.html#storage-schemas-conf).

1. Stop the container `docker stop graphite`.
1. Find the configuration files on the host by inspecting the container `docker inspect graphite`.
1. Update the desired config files.
1. Restart the container `docker start graphite`.

**Note**: If you change settings in `/opt/graphite/conf/storage-schemas.conf`
be sure to delete the old whisper files under `/opt/graphite/storage/whisper/`.

---

**Important:** Ensure your Statsd flush interval is at least as long as the highest-resolution retention.
For example, if `/opt/statsd/config/udp.js` looks like this.

```
flushInterval: 10000
```

Ensure that `storage-schemas.conf` retentions are no finer grained than 10 seconds.

```
[all]
pattern = .*
retentions = 5s:12h # WRONG
retentions = 10s:12h # OK
retentions = 60s:12h # OK
```

## Statsd Admin Management Interface

A management interface (default on port 8126) allows you to manage statsd & retrieve stats.

```sh
# show all current counters
echo counters | nc localhost 8126
```

[More info & additional commands.](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/blob/master/docs/admin_interface.md)

## A Note on Volumes

You may find it useful to mount explicit volumes so configs & data can be managed from a known location on the host.

Simply specify the desired volumes when starting the container.

```
docker run -d\
 --name graphite\
 --restart=always\
 -v /path/to/graphite/configs:/opt/graphite/conf\
 -v /path/to/graphite/data:/opt/graphite/storage\
 -v /path/to/statsd_config:/opt/statsd/config\
 graphiteapp/graphite-statsd
```

**Note**: The container will initialize properly if you mount empty volumes at
          `/opt/graphite/conf`, `/opt/graphite/storage`, or `/opt/statsd/config`.

## Memcached config

If you have a Memcached server running, and want to Graphite use it, you can do it using environment variables, like this:

```
docker run -d\
 --name graphite\
 --restart=always\
 -p 80:80\
 -p 2003-2004:2003-2004\
 -p 2023-2024:2023-2024\
 -p 8125:8125/udp\
 -p 8126:8126\
 -e "MEMCACHE_HOST=127.0.0.1:11211"\  # Memcached host. Separate by comma more than one servers.
 -e "CACHE_DURATION=60"\              # in seconds
 graphiteapp/graphite-statsd
```

Also, you can specify more than one memcached server, using commas:

```
-e "MEMCACHE_HOST=127.0.0.1:11211,10.0.0.1:11211"
```
## Running through docker-compose
The following command will start the graphite statsd container through docker-compose
```
docker-compose up
```

## Running through Kubernetes
You can use this 3-rd party repo with Graphite Helm chart - https://github.com/kiwigrid/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/graphite

## About `root` process 

This image uses `runit` as init system, to run multiple processes in single container. It's not against Docker guidelines but bit against Docker philosophy. Also, `runit` require root privileges to run, so, it's not possible to stop using root privileges, without completely rewrite this image. This is possible, of course, but it's better to use separate images per component then, and having separate repository for this new project. 

## Experimental Features
### go-carbon 

Use `GOCARBON=1` environment variable to enable [go-carbon](https://github.com/lomik/go-carbon) instance instead of normal Carbon. Use `GRAPHITE_CLUSTER_SERVERS="127.0.0.1:8000"` if you want also use [carbonserver](https://github.com/grobian/carbonserver) feature.

### brubeck

Use `BRUBECK=1` environment variable to enable [brubeck]() instance of normal Statsd. Please note that brubeck has different config format and not fully compatible with original statsd.
